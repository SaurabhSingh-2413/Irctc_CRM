<h3>Irctc CRM</h3>
<h5>From this website, we can check the information of our PNR. Whenever we go somewhere for a trip, we book all the trains and the ticket generated has a PNR which contains all the information about the passenger, such as when the journey is, what time the train will arrive at the station, what the train number is, how many people are there in this PNR, their seat numbers, and whether those seats are confirmed or not, we check this information through this CRM.</h5>
